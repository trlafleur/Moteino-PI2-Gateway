Cathode end of LED's are marked wrong on silk-screen

Warrning: On my Moteino's, prior to development of this board, 
I had cut the pin that supplies 3.3V from the FTDI connector. 
Not doing so, will cause the power from the FTDI and the PI2 to be in competition.
I suggest you cut the pin or make an adapter removing the 3.3v pin. Or remove Moteino
prior to programming.
